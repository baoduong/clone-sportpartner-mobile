            "answer_1": "Yes. You don't need to enter a surname or physical address while signing up. So no one knows who you are or where you live. What's more, your email address is only used to send you notifications, As such, it's not visible to others. You sign up only with a name. And this can be your first name, but most people use a username. You have conversations using the internal chat feature. If you arrange a real sports meeting, which is the point, then agree to meet in a public place where others are present.",
            "question_2": "2. Can I try Sportpartner for free?",
            "backhome": "Back to homepage",
            "answer_2": "Definitely! You can try Sportpartner for free and without obligations. As such, you're not bound to anything and you can see if there are enough interesting matches for you. It's only if you really want to talk to others that you can choose to become a Premium member.",
            "question_3": "3. Will my information be sold to third parties?",
            "answer_3": "Of course not! Your information is only needed to make it as easy as possible for you on the website. Your information will never be sold to third parties. Additionally, you only have to provide very little information at Sportpartner to become a member. We will not ask for a surname or an exact living address.",
            "question_4": "4. What's a high five?",
            "answer_4": "Sometimes, people find it hard to be the first to write someone a message. The high five is meant for this. This allows you to show interest without immediately having to come up with an entire message. The recipient knows you're interested and can respond with a message. Or with high five as well. ",
            "question_5": "5. Why hasn't my profile been approved?",
            "answer_5": "To maintain the quality of the website for you and others, all profiles are reviewed manually. They must meet certain conditions. Below, you find the most common reasons why a profile isn't approved. - The profile contains commercial information. For example, ads for products. - The profile contains personal information, like email addresses or phone numbers. - There were too many abbreviations and/or unclear texts in it. - The use of language was inappropriate/improper. - The profile had information that isn't relevant to Sportpartner.\nIf you're of the opinion that your profile has been wrongfully rejected, then let us know. Of course, it's possible that there's a mistake on our end. Send your profile again so it can be reviewed again. Log in to the website and go to the “My Account’ page. You can find it at the top right of the screen after you've logged in.",
            "question_6": "6. Why has my photo not been accepted?",
            "answer_6": "To maintain the quality of the website for you and others, all profiles are reviewed manually. They must meet certain conditions. Below, you'll find the most common reasons why a profile picture isn't approved: - It's a group photo. These are not allowed. It's only about you! - You can see personal information in this photo like a license plate or a complete address. - It's not a real photo. We like bunnies too, but they can't become members of Sportpartner. - The photo was offensive or inappropriate. When you're of the opinion that your photo has been wrongfully or accidentally rejected, then let us know. Naturally, this could be a mistake on our end. If you're right, we'll do everything to correct it.",
            "question_7": "7. How do I contact customer service?",
            "answer_7": "If your question isn't here, you can contact customer service. Our service team members work daily and often during the weekends as well. How? Log in and go to the customer service page. Fill in the form and our service team will respond as soon as possible.",
            "question_8": "8. How can I unsubscribe?",
            "answer_8": "It's easy to unsubscribe. Go to your settings. Scroll all the way down and you will find the unsubscribe button there. Keep in mind that this can't be undone. You will have to sign up again when your account has been removed. Additionally, you will also lose all your messages and contacts.",
            "question_9": "9. I want to change my password.",
            "answer_9": "Go to the settings page. There, you'll find a link to change your password. Don't use any strange characters, only letters and numbers.",

            "answer_10": "Go to your profile page. There, you can choose another name.",
            "question_11": "11. How much does the Premium membership cost?",
            "answer_11": "You can discover Sportpartner with the free Basic membership first. It's completely free to find out if there are enough matches for you. \n\nIf there are enough matches and you want to have conversations, only then you have to decide whether you want to become a Premium member or not. The costs depend on the duration of your chosen membership. The most current prices can always be found on the payment page. \n\nIn case you want to cancel your membership, you can do so at any desired moment. Give us a head's up using the customer form.",
            "question_12": "12. I have a new email address. How can I change this?",
            "answer_12": "Go to the settings page to change your email address.",
            "question_13": "13. How do I find out if someone sent me a message?",
            "answer_13": "That's easy. You'll receive a notification by e-mail. But it's worth the effort to frequently log in yourself and see what's going on near you.",
            "question_14": "14. Oops! I forgot how to log in!",
            "answer_14": "Don't panic! Go to the login page and click on “Forgot password”. Enter your e-mail address here and we'll send you an e-mail with a link. Click on the link and you'll go the page where you can create a new password.",
            "question_15": "15. I can't find my sport. How can this be?",
            "answer_15": "Sadly, there isn't enough interest for it then. But! Please tell us which sport you think is missing. Because if we receive the request more often, then we'll certainly add it. Like last year, we've added Padel. We got so many requests for it that we've added it. ",
            "question_16": "16. Should I really add a picture?",
            "answer_16": "Its highly highly recommended. But you don't have to. You really have a much higher chance of finding a sports partner. Besides, you'd like to see who you're dealing with too?",

            "description": "Walking is extremely popular and the biggest sport in the Netherlands after fitness. It's not just good for your health, but it also clears your head. That a lot of people like walking together shows in the huge success of Sportpartner. On this platform, you'll find tens of thousands of nice walking buddies, even near you. And with the same walking wants as you have.",
            "part1_content": "Marjolijn: “Walking is what I live for. When I was six, I went into the mountains with my parents. Even during my college years, I made many treks. Preferably in Norway. On my 50th birthday, I gave myself a huge gift, a trek to the base camp in Annapurna in Nepal. Recently, I have a lot more time again and I would love to walk some more again. I've asked my husband to walk the Hadrian's Wall, the Roman wall between Scotland and England that stretches coast to coast. He likes walking, but this was really too much for him. And there's even more on my wishlist. I would also like to go to Ladakh in India with someone to make a trek there. And also Ruta de la Plata, the old Roman trade route from Sevilla to Santiago, which I walked half of and would like to finish.",
            "part2_title": "45 walking buddies near you with one click.",
            "part2_content": "I also walked half of the Dutch Pieterpad with my old walking buddy, but due to family circumstances, she can no longer join me. So I asked around in my circle of friends and among my colleagues, looking for a walking buddy. But it had no results. Many people of my age are busy with grandchildren or are getting less fit. Then I started googling for a walking friend and quickly ended up at SportPartner. I didn't know about it and immediately found 45 walking buddies near me. With a picture and a story. Nice to see that not everyone has the same walking wants. For example, there are a lot of people practicing for the Nijmegen Four Days Marches. Not quite up my alley. I made contact with three women who had the same interests as I did.",
            "part3_title": "Walking together, but separate",
            "part3_content": "I immediately got along with the first woman when talking by email. Only she wanted to go on long treks in Canada carrying the tent on her back. That went too far even for me. With the second woman, I made a test walk and that was a lot of fun, but she wanted to walk more miles for the Four Day Marches. I'm not a big fan of walking long distances for the sake of it and walking in groups. I prefer shorter walks that allow me to appreciate the environment. Deer tracks or a nice church. In my spare time, I'm also a city guide in Zutphen and I like telling people stories about where they're walking or what they're seeing. I also provide readings, about my pilgrimages and also about mindfulness while walking. With my third sports partner, I've now started on the Hanze path of Doesburg to Kampen past the IJssel. We share a lot of interests which adds to the walking. We connected well, but she's sick now, so I'll continue looking on Sportpartner. I'm also curious whether there are more women who, like me, would like to walk together but separate. That we make a pilgrimage together but that we walk on our own and meet each other again at the end of the day. It'd be nice if SportPartner would create an extra button for that. Walking together but still alone. <Br><br> Thank you, Marjolijn, for your nice story and your tip! We really appreciate it when members contribute to what could be done different or better on our platform. And we'll put serious thought into how you can indicate your walking wants from now on. Until that time, you'll have to put them in your introduction text.",
